## BoardDom

### Introduction

BoardDom is a social networking application built for people who play board games. As a user, you can add a game to your collection, "like" or "dislike" a game, and search for users with similar tastes to facilitate fun and diverse board game nights.

BoardDom was designed in 3 days as a Dev Bootcamp client simulation. We practiced Agile methodologies in order to accomodate shifting client demands.
